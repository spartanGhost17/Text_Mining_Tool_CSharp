It was one January morning, very early, a pinching, frosty morning. The cove all grey with hoar frost,
the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to
seaward.
The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad
skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember
his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned
the big rock was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr Livesey.
